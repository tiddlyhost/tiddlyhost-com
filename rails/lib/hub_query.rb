# Because we chose to keep sites and tspot sites in separate schema with
# unrelated models we need to do some extra work here.
#
# The goal is to produce a sorted, filtered, paginated list of site-ish
# records for the hub. Luckily it's not too hard thanks to Arel,
# WillPaginate::Collection and some creative hackery... :)

  # TODO: Consider if we really need to join the blobs table. There is so much
  # complexity here related to the 'distinct on' and picking out the latest blob,
  # and the only real benefit is being able to access the blob's created at timestamp
  # to know when the site was last saved. Actually the sites updated_at is almost as
  # good so maybe it's not worth all the hoop jumping. Or we could add another
  # timestamp for saved_at and have it touched only when a save happens.
