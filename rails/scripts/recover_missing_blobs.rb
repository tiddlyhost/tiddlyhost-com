Hi #{site.user.username_or_name},

There was a Tiddlyhost outage on Sunday caused by a hosting provider incident. See https://status.linode.com/incidents/6yw88b0ft94g for details about the incident.

It caused some Tiddlyhost saves to fail, and for some sites it resulted in a persistent "500 Internal Server" problem.

Your site "#{site.name}" is one of the sites impacted.

To get the site working again I've restored it to an older saved version with timestamp "#{blob.created_at}", but unfortunately any later updates from July 27 are unable to be recovered.

In summary, https://#{site.name}.tiddlyhost.com/ has been recovered, but changes from July 27 have been lost.

Apologies,

Simon.
